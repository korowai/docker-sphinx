Docker container with [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) documentation generator.
The container is designed to build documentation for
[Korowai](https://github.com/korowai/korowai/) and
[Korowai Framework](https://github.com/korowai/framework/) out of the
box. It may be easily adjusted to support other projects.

## Features

With this container you can:

  - build documentation once and exit,
  - build documentation continuously and serve it at the same time.

The default behavior is to build continuously and serve at the same time.

## Quick example

Assume we have the following file hierarchy (the essential here is assumption
that sphinx configuration file `conf.py` is found under `docs/sphinx`)

```console
user@pc:$ tree .
.
`-- docs
    `-- sphinx
        |-- conf.py
        `-- index.rst
```

### Running with docker

Run it as follows

```console
user@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8000:8000 --user "`id -u`:`id -g`" korowai/sphinx
```

### Running with docker-compose

In the top level directory create `docker-compose.yml` containing the following

```yaml
version: '3'
# ....
services:
   # ...
   sphinx:
      image: korowai/sphinx
      ports:
         - "8000:8000"
      volumes:
         - ./:/code
      user: "1000:1000"
```

Then run

```console
user@pc:$ docker-compose up sphinx
```

### Results

Whatever method you chose to run the container, you shall see new directory

```console
user@pc:$ ls -d docs/build/*
docs/build/html
```

The documentation is written to `docs/build/html`

```console
user@pc:$ find docs -name 'index.html'
docs/build/html/index.html
```

As long as the container is running, the documentation is available at

  - <http://localhost:8000>.

## Customizing

Several parameters can be changed via environment variables, for example we can
change build directory to ``build/docs/html`` as follows

```console
user@pc:$ docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/code" -p 8000:8000 -e SPHINX_BUILD_DIR=build/docs/html korowai/sphinx
```

## Details

### Volume mount points exposed

  - `/code` - bind top level directory of your project here.

This may be changed with the configuration variable

### Working directory

  - `/code`

### Files inside container

#### In `/usr/local/bin`

  - scripts which may be used as container's command:
      - `autobuild` - builds documentation continuously (watches source
        directory for changes) and runs http server,
      - `build` - builds documentation once and exits,
  - other files
      - `sphinx-defaults` - initializes `DEFAULT_SPHINX_xxx` variables (default
        values),
      - `sphinx-env` - initializes `SPHINX_xxx` variables,
      - `sphinx-entrypoint` - provides an entry point for docker.

### Build arguments & environment variables

The container defines several build arguments which are copied to corresponding
environment variables within the running container. Most of the
arguments/variables have names starting with `SPHINX_` prefix. All the scripts
respect these variables, so the easiest way to adjust the container to your
needs is to set environment variables (`-e` flag to [docker](https://docker.com/)).
`KRW_CODE` is an exception, it must be defined at build time.
